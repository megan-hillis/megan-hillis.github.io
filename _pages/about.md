## Research
How does learning shape our brains? My research uses tools like fMRI to explore how we learn and understand new languages, new concepts, and new skills. My dissertation work focused on multivariate neural patterns associated with semantic information in American Sign Language (ASL) that emerge in novices learners over the first hours to weeks of signing. Even with such limited training, we can detect patterns that track not only semantic information from the ASL lessons, but individual differences in how well students can recall that information.

I have also collaborated with researchers across many departments and disciplines to apply these methods in different domains (STEM concept learning, reading music notation, dance), and sensing modalities (e.g. mobile biosensing including EEG, EDA, video).

## About
I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at Dartmouth College in 2025. Before that, I received an M.S. in Psychological and Brain Sciences from Dartmouth and a B.A. in Psychology from SUNY Geneseo.
I first got curious about how brains acquire and scaffold new information while I was working as a STEM program specialist for the Girl Scouts of Northeastern New York!
Outside of the lab, I enjoy tabletop games and exploring the beautiful mountains of New Hampshire.

### I am looking for opportunities for postdoctoral research, with an ideal start date in early 2026! Please feel welcome to reach out to me:
